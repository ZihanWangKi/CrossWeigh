## Motivation 

The label annotation mistakes by human annotators brings up two challenges to NER:  
- mistakes in the test set can interfere the evaluation results and even lead to an inaccurate assessment of model performance.
- mistakes in the training set can hurt NER model training. 

We address these two problems by:
- manually correcting the mistakes in the test set to form a cleaner benchmark.
- develop framework `CrossWeigh` to handle the mistakes in the training set. 
<p align="center"><img width="100%" src="img/CrossWeigh.jpg"/></p>

`CrossWeigh` works with any NER algorithm that accepts weighted training instances. It
is composed of two modules. 1) mistake estimation: where potential mistakes are identified in the training
data through a cross-checking process and 2) mistake re-weighing: where weights of those mistakes are lowered
during training the final NER model.

## Data
We formally name our corrected dataset as CoNLL++.  
`/data/conllpp_test.txt` is the manually corrected test set, there should be exactly 186 sentences that 
differ from the original test set.  
`/data/conllpp_train.txt` and `/data/conllpp_dev.txt` are the original dataset of CoNLL03 from [Named-Entity-Recognition-NER-Papers](https://github.com/pfliu-nlp/Named-Entity-Recognition-NER-Papers).

## Scripts
`split.py` can be used to generate a k-fold entity disjoint dataset from a list of datasets(usually both the train and development set)  
`flair_scripts/flair_ner.py` can be used to train a weighted version of flair.  
`collect.py` can be used to collect all the predictions on the k folded test set.  

## Steps to reproduce
Make sure you are in a python3.6+ environment.  
See [example.sh](example.sh) to reproduce the results.  
Using [Flair](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair) (non-pooled version), the final result should achieve
around 93.19F1 on the original test dataset and 94.18F1 on the corrected test set. Using Flair without CrossWeigh gives
around 92.9F1.  

## Results
All the results are averaged across 5 runs and standard deviation is reported.

For all models, we use their suggested parameter settings.  
For GCDT, we used the weights estimated from Pooled-Flair for efficiency purposes.
